# Build tools

To customize Mobi.css, you need to be familiar with some tools.

## npm

npm is the node package manager.

We use npm to install, run scripts, manage versions.

Once cloned Mobi.css main repository or plugin/theme repos, the `package.json` descripts some avalible scripts.

The basic scripts are `npm install`, `npm start` and `npm test`:

```bash
npm install     # Install the dependencies
npm start       # Build css, js and docs. Serve public. Watch changes
npm test        # Run lint and tests
```

Other useful scripts:

```bash
npm run build   # Build css, js and docs
npm run lint    # Lint styles and scripts
npm version patch/minor/major
                # Update the version. This will run preversion and version scripts
npm publish     # Publish the current version
```

## gulp

gulp is a task runner for development.

Actually `npm start` and `npm build` are simply run gulp tasks.

## Sass

Sass is a css preprocessor.

We use SCSS syntax to write css.

## PostCSS

PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins.

We use [Autoprefixer]((https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)) plugin to ensure Mobi.css works on all major mobile devices.

## stylelint

Stylelint is a mighty, modern CSS linter.

## ESLint

ESLint is a JavaScript linter.

## Pagic

[Pagic](https://github.com/xcatliu/pagic) is a static site generator, most of Mobi.css docs are generated by it.
